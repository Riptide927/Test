The best movie I saw this summer was who killed captain alex. Who killed captain alex is the most popular realse from director/producer/writter Nabwana Isaac Geoffrey Godfrey and his company wakiliwood. The movie was realesed in 2010 to crtitical and comercial aclaim. The movie was realsed for free online and was produced with just a 200$ budjet but despite the budjget Nabwana Isaac Geoffrey Godfrey managed to create a compelling story. The story is about a man, captain alex who is killed trying to take down the fearsome tiger mafia. The story follows Bruce U who is uganda shoalin monk renouned for his mastery of the art of Kung fu. Bruce spends the movie trying to find who killed captain alex. Overall this is the greatest movie ive ever seen and would highly recomend.
